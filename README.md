Here l would to present my first lab on virtualisation:
1. First step is creation of virtual machine using virtual box and ubuntu image distribution
2. Second the is utilizing free -mh and df /dev/sda1 -h commands which help to found out the memory usage and load (first image)
3. Third step is installing docker and launching docker image Hello from Docker ( second image)
4. Last step is repeted utilization of commands  free -mh and df /dev/sda1 -h. Which showed that after running docker image system used more memory and load (third image)
